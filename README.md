# Obsidian Plugin for DMs

Where does the name come from? I asked my brother to come up with a name. He said "Drunk DM". One of my early D&D characters that I am attached to was named Anremithrl. Conclusion? Anremithrl's drunk DM. Is that a terrible name? Maybe.

Planned features.

Rolling syntax: In-line rolls you can click and save to a session file. Something like `[roll: 1d6]` and it saves to some "Current session file"

Generate next session button. Creates new session file.

Initiative tracking? Don't know how I'd do that, but that'd be cool.
